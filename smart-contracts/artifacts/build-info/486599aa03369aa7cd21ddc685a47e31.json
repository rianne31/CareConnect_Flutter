This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it.

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier.

The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions.

Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"title\":\"EIP-721 Metadata Update Extension\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC4906.sol\":\"IERC4906\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd04b0f06e0666f29cf7cccc82894de541e19bb30a765b107b1e40bb7fe5f7d7a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7b652499d098e88d8d878374616bb58434301061cae2253298b3f374044e0ddb\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbhAzctqo5jrSKU6idHdVyqfmzCcDbNUPvmx4GiXxfA6q\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC4906.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2a9dadb806be80dd451821f1f1190eb9aa6f6edae85b185db29d60767cc0c5f4\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5c25cac8dbe5bd96320053d23c3dacdb875e629d7c53ac00892eb7aa8500bde6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmaf2oqbxxdJA9DphAoH4UCb8aXEAVM8fnu6qMxHJ5ta4A\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xaf297d12d8d4a57fe01a70f0ef38908f208e3faedc577056d0b728fa2f3ccf0c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fbfaf37123958822a2720a4ea29651be00edab787540b770f73d3e025d286ff8\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbzgWeTm8hJVUqWrNAwFjshqbYVyeGpQA8D1huzxQdmw6\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5bce51e11f7d194b79ea59fe00c9e8de9fa2c5530124960f29a24d4c740a3266\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7e66dfde185df46104c11bc89d08fa0760737aa59a2b8546a656473d810a8ea4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXvyqtXPaPss2PD7eqPoSao5Szm2n6UMoiG8TZZDjmChR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol":{"Pausable":{"abi":[{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"Paused","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"Unpaused","type":"event"},{"inputs":[],"name":"paused","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{"paused()":"5c975abb"}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":false,\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"account\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"Paused\",\"type\":\"event\"},{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":false,\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"account\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"Unpaused\",\"type\":\"event\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"paused\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bool\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Contract module which allows children to implement an emergency stop mechanism that can be triggered by an authorized account.
